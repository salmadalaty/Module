<h1> C++ Project: [MODULE]</h1>
Overview
This project is part of the 42 Common Core C++ Module series and focuses on deepening our understanding of C++ programming concepts such as [e.g., object-oriented programming, templates, memory management, etc.]. It is designed to introduce advanced programming techniques while adhering to strict coding standards.

<h1>Project Objectives</h1>
Understand and apply [concepts like polymorphism, abstract classes, inheritance, etc.].
Build modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
Adhere to the C++98 standard and learn about its constraints.
Solve [specific problems] using efficient algorithms.
Key Features
Implementation of:
Classes and Objects: Encapsulation and abstraction of [core components].
Inheritance: To extend functionality while avoiding code duplication.
Polymorphism: Dynamic behavior with virtual methods.
[Additional Features]: [e.g., Smart pointers, STL containers, exception handling].
Usage
Input: Describe the type of input the program accepts (if any).
Example:

./program_name [arguments].
Output: Describe what the output will look like.
Example:

A detailed log of operations performed.
Implementation Details
Core Concepts Used:
[Concept 1]: Brief explanation.
[Concept 2]: Brief explanation.
Challenges:
Describe any challenges encountered and how they were resolved.
Technologies Used
Language: C++ (C++98 standard).
Tools:
Compiler: g++ with flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98.
Makefile: To streamline the build process.
Libraries:
Standard Template Library (STL) for [purpose, e.g., containers, algorithms].
